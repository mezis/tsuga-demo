This is a demo is a testbed for [tsuga](http://github.com/mezis/tsuga), a
**clustering engine** for geographical data (points of interest) that
produces a **tree** of clusters, with depths matching zoomlevels on typical
maps, and source points of interest as leaves.

It's build with Backbone and Rails, and uses Tsuga's ActiveRecord adapter.

You're welcome to have a play with a [live hosted demo](http://tsuga-demo.herokuapp.com),
loaded with a small dataset (the 1,500 restaurants and cafes in Barcelona, Spain).
